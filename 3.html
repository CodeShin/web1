<h2>JavaScript</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" title="wikipeida">JavaScript</a> often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It is a language which is also characterized as <strong>dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm</strong>.</p>

<p style="margin-top:30px;">Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.[7] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it,[8] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
</p><p>
As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.
